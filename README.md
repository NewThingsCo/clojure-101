## Some VIM settings which I find good

There is lots of vim configurations and like with any editor everybody has their own preferences. [Exmple Amix vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

There are from my ~/.vimrc

```vim
" Softtabs, 2 spaces
set tabstop=2
set shiftwidth=2
set shiftround
set expandtab

" Share the clipboard outside of macvim
set clipboard=unnamed

" Auto format any pasted text
nnoremap P P=`]
nnoremap p p=`]

" don't use vim backup files
set nobackup
set nowritebackup

" autorefresh changes from FS
set autoread

" Look and feel
set ruler               " set ruler
set number              " add line numbers
"set colorcolumn=80      " add line marker at 80 characters

" Mappings and shortcuts
"make jj do esc"
inoremap jj <Esc>

" use space as leader key
let mapleader = "\<Space>"

" Clojure write and require with one command
command! WriteAndRequire w|Require
map <leader>w :WriteAndRequire<CR>

" Searching and indexing
" Ignore case when searching
set ignorecase

" When searching try to be smart about cases
set smartcase

" Highlight search results
set hlsearch

" Windows, buffers & navigation
" Switch between the last two files
nnoremap <leader><leader> <c-^>
```
